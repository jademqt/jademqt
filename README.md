- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jademqt
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in networking and algorithm.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning networks and cybersecurity at Uni in France.

You'll find :
- :red_car: My files / researches about ITS (Intelligent Transport System) in "ITS" repository 
- :books: My master classes in "Master_1" repository.

:mega: Word of caution :
These files are not necessarily all complete or completely accurate (especially the parts highlighted in yellow)
